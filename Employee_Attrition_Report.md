# Employee Attrition Prediction - Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The analysis identifies key factors contributing to employee turnover and provides actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Records**: 1,470 employees
- **Features**: 35 attributes (after preprocessing)
- **Target Variable**: Attrition (Yes/No)
- **Attrition Rate**: 16.1% (237 out of 1,470 employees)

## Key Findings

### 1. Class Imbalance Challenge
- **Imbalance Ratio**: 5.2:1 (No Attrition : Attrition)
- **Impact**: Standard models tend to favor the majority class
- **Solution**: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

### 2. Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Precision (Attrition) | Recall (Attrition) | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Random Forest (Original) | 86.4% | 0.65 | 0.42 | 0.51 |
| Random Forest (Balanced) | 84.7% | 0.58 | 0.58 | 0.58 |
| **Random Forest (SMOTE)** | **85.7%** | **0.62** | **0.65** | **0.63** |

**Best Model**: Random Forest with SMOTE achieved the best balanced performance.

### 3. Top 10 Most Important Features

1. **MonthlyIncome** (0.089) - Higher income correlates with lower attrition
2. **Age** (0.087) - Younger employees more likely to leave
3. **TotalWorkingYears** (0.074) - Experience level affects retention
4. **YearsAtCompany** (0.067) - Tenure is a strong predictor
5. **DistanceFromHome** (0.063) - Commute distance impacts retention
6. **YearsInCurrentRole** (0.058) - Role tenure affects satisfaction
7. **MonthlyRate** (0.055) - Compensation structure matters
8. **YearsWithCurrManager** (0.054) - Manager relationship is crucial
9. **DailyRate** (0.053) - Daily compensation affects retention
10. **JobSatisfaction** (0.048) - Direct correlation with retention

### 4. Satisfaction Metrics Analysis

**Correlation with Attrition** (negative values indicate lower satisfaction leads to higher attrition):
- **JobSatisfaction**: -0.103
- **EnvironmentSatisfaction**: -0.103
- **WorkLifeBalance**: -0.164
- **RelationshipSatisfaction**: -0.053

**Key Insight**: Work-life balance shows the strongest negative correlation with attrition.

## Business Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)
1. **Compensation Review**: Focus on employees with below-market monthly income
2. **Work-Life Balance Programs**: Implement flexible working arrangements
3. **Manager Training**: Improve manager-employee relationships
4. **Remote Work Options**: Address distance from home concerns

### Medium-term Strategies (3-12 months)
1. **Career Development**: Create clear progression paths for younger employees
2. **Retention Bonuses**: Target employees with 2-5 years of experience
3. **Job Enrichment**: Enhance job satisfaction through meaningful work
4. **Environment Improvements**: Address workplace satisfaction issues

### Long-term Initiatives (1+ years)
1. **Predictive Analytics**: Implement real-time attrition risk monitoring
2. **Culture Transformation**: Build a retention-focused organizational culture
3. **Succession Planning**: Develop internal talent pipelines
4. **Regular Surveys**: Continuous monitoring of satisfaction metrics

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Employee Profile
- **Age**: Under 35 years
- **Income**: Below company median
- **Tenure**: 1-3 years at company
- **Commute**: >15 miles from home
- **Satisfaction**: Low job/environment satisfaction scores
- **Work-Life Balance**: Poor rating (1-2 out of 4)

### Early Warning Indicators
- Declining satisfaction survey scores
- Increased overtime without compensation adjustment
- Long tenure in same role without promotion
- New manager assignments
- Salary below market rate for experience level

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Applied StandardScaler for numerical features
- Removed non-predictive columns (EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, StandardHours)
- Used SMOTE to address class imbalance

### Model Selection Rationale
- **Random Forest**: Chosen for interpretability and robust performance
- **SMOTE**: Applied to handle 5.2:1 class imbalance
- **Cross-validation**: Used stratified sampling to maintain class distribution

### Feature Engineering
- No additional features created (rich dataset)
- Focus on proper encoding and scaling
- Maintained interpretability for business stakeholders

## ROI Estimation

### Cost of Attrition (per employee)
- **Recruitment**: $15,000 - $25,000
- **Training**: $10,000 - $15,000
- **Lost Productivity**: $20,000 - $50,000
- **Total Cost**: $45,000 - $90,000 per departure

### Potential Savings
- **Current Annual Attrition**: 237 employees
- **Estimated Cost**: $10.7M - $21.3M annually
- **Target Reduction**: 25% (59 employees)
- **Potential Savings**: $2.7M - $5.3M annually

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Model**: Implement prediction system for HR team
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track model accuracy over time
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect HR team input on predictions
4. **Refine Model**: Update with new data quarterly
5. **Expand Analysis**: Include additional data sources (performance reviews, training records)

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully identified key drivers of employee attrition and developed a predictive model with 85.7% accuracy. The most critical factors are compensation, age, experience, and work-life balance. Implementing the recommended retention strategies could potentially save the organization $2.7M - $5.3M annually while improving employee satisfaction and organizational stability.
